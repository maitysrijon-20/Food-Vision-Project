# Food Vision project

An image classification project where i've built a transfer learning model and trained the model on the [Food101](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) dataset. It consists of 101 classes of food images.

In this project i try to beat the accuracy achieved by the [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment) paper. It is a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
My model has achieved a little over 80% accuracy after evaluating the trained model on test data, and it took a around 20 mins to train the model.
